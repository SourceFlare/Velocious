# codename-borris
>Fast/Barebones Closure-Based RESTful Framework.  Thsi framework is so lightweight that it's barebones; it doesn't even come with an ORM, Security Classes, or other Helpers; it comprises of router, mime type detector, and a dispatcher - that is it.

>Codename-Borris is by it's nature designed to offer up streamlined APIs and small operations such as logging, or sending an email, where having a full-blown MVC framework is not required.
